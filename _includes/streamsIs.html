Streams is a platform for distributed, efficient, fault-tolerant, real-time computation.  Applications can be written in 
SPL, a langauge developed specifically for streaming.  SPL allows you to build your own operators using either C++ or Java.
The new Java Application API allows you to write applications in Java alone.
